Macromolecular models
*********************


MacSyLib relies on the definition of models of macromolecular systems as a **set of models' components**
to be searched by similarity search, and a **set of rules** regarding their genomic organization and
their requirement level to make a complete system (mandatory, accessory components, number of components required).

See :ref:`below<model-definition-grammar-label>` for more details on MacSyLib's modelling scheme and the section
on :ref:`Functioning <functioning>` for the principles of the MacSyLib's search engine.


A **MacSyLib model** (macsy-model for short) is the association of several elements:

    * a **definition** which describes the system to detect with a specific **XML grammar** that is described :ref:`below<model-definition-grammar-label>`.

    * a set of :ref:`HMM profiles <provide-hmm_label>`  (one per component/gene in the model) to enable the similarity search of the systems' components with the HMMER program.

The models are grouped by *family* possibly gathering *sub-families* (multiple levels allowed), for instance *Secretion*, *Cas-proteins*...
A set of models from a same family (coherent set) of systems to detect is called hereafter a **macsy-model package**.


.. note::
  For details on how to create your own macsy-models, have a look at the :ref:`modeler_guide`.

Installing  models
******************


How to install new models
=========================

MacSyLib does not provide models. You must install models before using it.
The ``msl_data`` utility tool is shipped with `MacSyLib` to deal with macsy-models:


msl_data <subcommand> [options]

The main sub-commands are

* ``msl_data available`` to get the list of macsy-models available
* ``msl_data search`` to search a model given its name or a pattern in its description
* ``msl_data install`` to install a macsy-model package (the installed version can be set see --help)
* ``msl_data cite`` to retrieve information on how to cite the model
* ``msl_data definition`` to display one or a set of model defintion
* ``msl_data --help`` to get the extended list of available subcommands
* ``msl_data <subcommand> --help`` to get help about the specified subcommand


Where the models are located
============================

MacSyLib looks at several locations to find macsy-models.

system-wide installation
------------------------

By default *msl_data* installs models in a shared location (set by --install-data option) that is
`/usr/share/macsylib/` or `/usr/local/share/macsylib` depending on your Operating System distribution.
If you use a *virtualenv*, the shared resources are located in the `<virtualenv>/share/macsylib` directory.


user-wide installation
----------------------

If you don't own rights to install system-wide, you can install models in the MacSyLib's cache
located in your home: `$HOME/.macsylib/data/`.
*msl_data* installs packages in this location when you use the `--user` option.
The packages installed in user land is added to the system-wide packages.


.. note::
	If two packages have the same name, the package in the user land supersedes the system-wide package.


project-wide installation
-------------------------

If you cannot install macsy-model packages in system or user land locations,
you can install models in specific directory with the `--target` option.

    msl_data install --target <my_models>

The specify this specific location with the ``--models-dir`` :ref:`command-line option <path-options>`.

    MacSyLib --db-type ordered_replicon --models-dir=my_models --models TFF-SF all --sequence-db my_genome.fasta

The path must point at a directory that contains macsy-model packages as described :ref:`above <package_structure>`.
