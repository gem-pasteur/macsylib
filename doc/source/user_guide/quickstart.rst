1. We recommend to install MacSylib using `pip` in a virtual environment (for further details see :ref:`user_installation`).

   .. code-block:: bash

        python3 -m venv MacSyLib
        cd MacSyLib
        source bin/activate
        pip install macsylib

   .. warning::

        `hmmsearch` from the HMMER package (http://hmmer.org/) must be installed.

2. Prepare your data. You need a file containing all protein sequences of your genome of interest in a FASTA file
   (for further details see :ref:`input-dataset-label`). In the best case scenario, they would be ordered as the
   corresponding genes are ordered along the replicons.

3. You need to install, or make available to MacSyFinder the models to search in your input genome data.
   Please refer to :ref:`model_definition` to create your own package of models.
   Otherwise, macsy-models contributed by the community are available here: https://github.com/macsy-models
   and can be retrieved and installed using the :ref:`msl_data <msl_data>` command, installed as part of the MacSylib suite.

4. Install the macsy-models of interest from the `Macsy Models repository <https://github.com/macsy-models>`_:

      :code:`msl_data available`

      :code:`msl_data install some-public-models`

5. Use MacSylib :ref:`python-example`
