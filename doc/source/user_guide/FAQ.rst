How to report an issue?
-----------------------

If you encounter a problem while running MacSyLib, please submit an issue on the dedicated page of the `GitHub project <https://github.com/gem-pasteur/macsylib/issues>`_

To ensure we have all elements to help, please provide:

- a concise description of the issue
- the expected behavior VS observed one
- the exact command-line used
- the version of MacSyFinder used
- the exact error message, and if applicable, the `<macsylib>.log` and `<macsylib>.conf` files
- if applicable, an archive (or link to it) with the output files obtained
- if possible, the smallest dataset there is to reproduce the issue
- if applicable, this would also include the macsy-models (XML models plus HMM profiles) used (or precise version of the models if there are publicly available). Same as above, if possible, please provide the smallest set possible of models and HMM profiles.

All these will definitely help us to help you! ;-)

.. note::

    If you use ``macsylib`` in higher level script you can change <macsylib> by the name of your tool by setting it in :class:`macsylib.config.MacsyDefault` prog_name parameter.

How to use MacSyLib ?
---------------------


Here are an example of analyse with a python script using macsylib:

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/code/msl_example.py
   :language: python

The script above will produce the file below with a summary of all systems found.

.. literalinclude:: ../_static/msl_example_all_systems.tsv
   :language: text

The code and the data are available

:download:`msl_example.py <../_static/code/msl_example.py>` .

:download:`test.fasta <../_static/test.fasta>` .

| For more details check the developer guide :ref:`developer_guide` and api documentation :ref:`api`

.. _faq-search-mode:

What search mode to be used?
----------------------------

Depending on the type of dataset you have, you will have to adapt MacSyFinder's search mode.

- If you have a fasta file from a complete genome where **proteins are ordered** according to the corresponding genes' order along the replicon,
  your dataset is entitled to the most powerful search mode (see below): `ordered_replicon` and use the following option `--db-type ordered_replicon`.

- If you have a fasta file of proteins with **no sense of the order** of the corresponding genes along the chromosome(s) or replicon(s),
  you will have to use the `unordered` search mode with the following option: `--db-type unordered`

- If you have **multiple ordered replicons** to analyse at once, you can follow the `Gembase` convention to name the proteins in the fasta file,
  so that the original replicons can be assessed from their name: :ref:`see here for a description <gembase_convention>`.

.. note::

 - When the **gene order is known** (`ordered_replicon` search mode) the power of the analysis is **maximal**,
   since both the genomic content and context are taken into account for the search.

 - When the **gene order is unknown** (`unordered` search mode) the power of the analysis is more **limited** since
   the presence of systems can only be suggested on the basis of the quorum of components - and not based on genomic context information.

How to deal with fragmented genomes (MAGs, SAGs, draft genomes)?
----------------------------------------------------------------

There are more and more genomes available which are not completely assembled, or are fragmented and incomplete.
In this case, several options can be considered.

1. If your genome is at least partially assembled and contigs are not too short, you might "feel lucky" and first
consider to run MacSyFinder with the `ordered_replicon` mode. It could be particularly efficient if you are investigating
systems encoded by compact loci (Cas systems, some secretion systems...), as they might be encoded by a single contig.

2. On top of the `ordered_replicon` mode, you might add the option "multi-loci" to the systems to annotate (if not already the case),
in order to maximize the chance to annotate an entire system, even if encoded across several contigs.

3. The `unordered` mode can be used in complement of the two above options, e.g. to retrieve some of the missing components.
It will enable to assess the genetic potential and possible presence of a system, independently of the quality of assembly of the genome.
It might also be the only reasonable option if the genome is too fragmented and/or too incomplete.

.. note::

 - The results obtained with the `ordered_replicon` mode on a fragmented genome have to be considered carefully, especially with respect
   to the contigs' borders, as some proteins from different contigs might be artificially considered as closely encoded.

 - To retrieve "fragments" of a system not found to reach the quorum in the `ordered_replicon` mode, it is possible to retrieve
   clusters of genes from the *rejected_candidates.tsv* file.


How to interpret the results from an `unordered` search?
--------------------------------------------------------

As mentioned above, in the `unordered` search mode, the inference of a system's presence is only based on the list of components found in the protein dataset.
Thus, the kind of search specificity provided when using the genomic context
(components next to each other are more likely to be part of a same system's occurrence) is not within reach.

In the `unordered` search mode, the number of proteins selected as system's components
(based on the filtering of HMM profiles' similarity search) is reported.
We decided to report all kinds of system's components, including the `forbidden` ones in order to raise awareness of
the user -> even if all constraints are met for the system's inference
(here, the quorum: minimal number of components), it cannot be excluded that a `forbidden`
component would lie next to the *bona fide* components (`mandatory` and `accessory` ones) in the genome...

In the end, the `unordered` search mode provides an idea as to whether the **genetic potential** for
a given system is found in the set of proteins analysed, with no attempt to assign proteins to particular systems' occurrences,
nor guarantee as to whether `forbidden` components should be considered for the potential occurrences.


Where to find MacSyLib models?
------------------------------

Since version 2, there is a tool to enable the download and installation of published models from a repository: the `msl_data` tool.

See :ref:`here for details <msl_data>` on how to use it.



What are the rules for options precedence?
------------------------------------------

MacSyLib offers many ways to parametrize the systems' search: through the command-line,
through various configuration files (for the models, for the run, etc...).
It offers a large control over the search engine. But it also means you can get lost in configuration. ;-)

Here is a recap of the rules for options precedence. In a general manner, the command line always wins.

The precedence rules between the different levels of configuration are:

.. code-block:: text

 system < home < model < project < --cfg-file | --previous-run < command line options

* **system**: the `<macsylib>.conf` file either in ${VIRTUAL_ENV}/etc/<macsylib>/
  in case of a *virtualenv* this configuration affects only the MacSyFinder version installed in this virtualenv
* **home**:  the `~/.<macsylib>/<macsylib>.conf` file
* **model**: the `model_conf.xml` file at the root of the model package
* **project**: the `<macsylib>.conf` file found in the directory where the `macsylib` command was run
* **cfgfile**: any configuration file specified by the user on the command line
* **previous-run**: the `<macsylib>.conf` file found in the results directory of the previous run
